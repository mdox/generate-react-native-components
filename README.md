# Generate React Native Components

A tool to generate React Native component files from JSON.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
```

> Edit the `./src/components.schema.js`. (see the `./src/components.schema.example.js`)

```bash
npm run gen
```

## Motivation

I always make a bibliography from UI design to get the components structure right. But to create those files by hand takes too much of the time. So I needed a solution to reduce the time of creating component files.
