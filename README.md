# Generate React Native Components

A tool to generate React Native component files from JSON.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
```

> Edit the `./src/components.schema.js`. (see the `./src/components.schema.example.js`)

```bash
npm run gen
```

## Motivation

I always create a bibliography for UI design to ensure the correct structure of components. However, manually creating these files takes up too much time. Therefore, I needed a solution to reduce the time spent on creating component files.
